# Hope

Hope is an exploration adventure. Your goal is to explore and solve some
procedural generated maze scenaries surviving to the maze's hazards and
discovering the story behind the walls of the labyrinth.

## Still in development

Hope is still in development and only a small slice of its features is visible
right now.

## Controls

casting a powerfull spell and release with `q` to blow the walls of the
labyrinth up!
